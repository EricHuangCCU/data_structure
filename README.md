There are some cool question

# HW1 
Given a quantum network with limited resources and multiple source-destination(SD) requests, our goal is to maximize the number of accepted SD requests.

#HW2
Given wireless transmission resource(frequency, time) and users, each of which has a set of candidate shapes, the goal is to maximized the number of accepted requests.

#HW3
Given the coordinate of Internet-of-Things(IoT) devices and a time threshold B to limit a flying tour, our goal is to use the least UAV to traverse all the IoT.

#HW4
Given many data strings stored in the srever, our goal is to build a merkle tree and compare with the tree build by the master, if detect wrong, print the incorrect data string.
